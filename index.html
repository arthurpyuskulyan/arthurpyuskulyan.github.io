            <p>Molecules are fascinating because they hold the secrets to so many processes in nature, from the way light interacts with matter to the mechanics of chemical reactions, energy transfer, and excited state relaxation. Each molecule is like its own little world, with atoms vibrating, rotating, and interacting in ways that reveal underlying physics, chemistry, and even the foundations of life itself. Plus, thereâ€™s always more to discover. Molecules can behave differently under various conditions, environments, or when they are excited by light, so exploring them often feels like solving a puzzle or uncovering a mystery.</p>
            <p>  I am dedicated to developing theoretical and computational skills modeling nature through math, physics, chemistry, and coding. I strive to spend the rest of my time working as a researcher. It is the unknown and it is very interesting solving important problems that have not yet been solved before or even thought of. Through research, I also seek to to develop skills in simulations and understanding nature to develop newer advanced technologies.  </p>
