    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Arthur Pyuskulyan   Molecules are fascinating because they hold the secrets to so many processes in nature, from the way light interacts with matter to the mechanics of chemical reactions and energy transfer. Each molecule is like its own little world, with atoms vibrating, rotating, and interacting in ways that reveal underlying physics, chemistry, and even the foundations of life itself.
Plus, thereâ€™s always more to discover. Molecules can behave differently under various conditions, environments, or when they are excited by light, so exploring them often feels like solving a puzzle or uncovering a mystery.
